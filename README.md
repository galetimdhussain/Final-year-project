# HYBRID APPROACH FOR ELECTRIICTY PRICE FORECASTING USING ALEXNET AND LSTM

Electricity price forecasting plays a crucial role in energy market operations, assisting 
stakeholders in decision-making, optimizing resource allocation, and mitigating financial 
risks. However, the inherently volatile nature of electricity prices, influenced by factors such 
as demand fluctuations, generation capacity, regulatory policies, and market conditions, 
presents a significant challenge. To address this complexity, we propose a novel hybrid 
forecasting model that integrates AlexNet, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN), with 
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), a specialized recurrent neural network (RNN) designed 
for sequential data modeling. This unique combination leverages the strengths of both 
architectures: AlexNet’s ability to extract high-level spatial features from structured market 
and historical price data, and LSTM’s proficiency in capturing long-term dependencies and 
temporal patterns. In this approach, electricity price data is preprocessed and converted into a 
structured format suitable for deep learning. AlexNet extracts meaningful representations 
from time-series price data, capturing underlying spatial correlations and feature 
dependencies, which are then passed to the LSTM network for sequence learning. The LSTM 
model processes these enriched features to model temporal dependencies and forecast future 
electricity prices. By combining deep feature extraction with sequential learning, the proposed 
framework achieves enhanced prediction accuracy and robustness compared to traditional 
statistical and standalone machine learning models.
